# ChowTown
# Restaurant Management System
# By: Mahin Khan, Wei-Cheng Lin, Sumaiya Mahin, and Risa Morishima

# To get system working:
# Install MySQL, run the chowtown.sql file, and change the root name and password in the main class to the root name and password that corresponds to your MySQL account to connect to the database. It's preferred to run this project in the Eclipse IDE, as it was made on Eclipse.
# *Note: additional steps may need to be taken if other IDEs or command line are used
